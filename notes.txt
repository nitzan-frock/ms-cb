 See, webpack-dev-server is actually serving the bundled files from memory — once the server stops, 
 they’re gone. To actually build your files, we’re going to utilize webpack proper — add a script 
 called build in your package.json with the following command: webpack --mode development. You can 
 replace development with production, but if you completely omit --mode, it will fall back to the 
 latter and give you a warning.
